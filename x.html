  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal" > A web portal is a specially</a>
            designed website that brings information from
            diverse sources, like emails, online forums and search engines, together
            in a uniform way.
            Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for
            displaying information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones
            to display.
            Variants of portals include mashups and intranet "dashboards" for
            executives and managers. The extent to which content is displayed in a
            "uniform way" may depend on the intended user and the intended purpose,
            as well as the diversity of the content. Very often design emphasis
            is on a certain "metaphor" for configuring and customizing
            the presentation of the content (e.g., a dashboard or map) and the
            chosen implementation framework or code libraries. In addition,
            the role of the user in an organization may determine which content
            can be added to the portal or deleted from the portal configuration.</p>

      <p>
          A portal may use a search engine's application programming interface (API)
          to permit users to search intranet content as opposed to extranet content
          by restricting which domains may be searched. Apart from this common
          search engines feature,
          web portals may offer other services such as e-mail, news, stock quotes,
          information from databases and even entertainment content.
          Portals provide a way for enterprises and organizations to provide a
          consistent "look and feel" with access control and procedures
          for multiple applications and databases, which otherwise
          would have been different web entities at various URLs.
          The features available may be restricted by whether access is by an
          authorized and authenticated user (employee, member) or an anonymous
          website visitor.</p>

    <p> Examples of early public web portals were AOL, Excite, Netvibes, iGoogle, MSN, Naver, Lycos, Prodigy, Indiatimes, Rediff, and Yahoo!. See for example, the "My Yahoo!" feature of Yahoo! that may have inspired such features as the later Google "iGoogle" (discontinued as of November 1, 2013.) The configurable side-panels of, for example,
        the modern Opera browser and the option of "speed dial" pages
        by most browsers continue to reflect the earlier "portal" metaphor.<br></p>

        <p><h4>History</h4>
          In the late 1990s the Web portal was a Web IT buzzword. After the proliferation of
          Web browsers in the late-1990s many companies tried to build or acquire a portal
          to attempt to obtain a share of an Internet market. The Web portal gained special
          attention because it was, for many users, the starting point of their Web browsing
          if it was set as their home page. The content and branding of a portal could change
          as Internet companies merged or were acquired.
          Netscape became a part of America Online, the Walt Disney Company launched Go.com,
          IBM and others launched Prodigy (-only users.)
          Portal metaphors are widely used by public library sites for borrowers using a login as users and by university intranets for students and for faculty.
          Vertical markets remain for ISV's (Independent Software Vendors) offering management and executive intranet "dashboards" for corporations
          and government agencies in areas such as GRC and risk management.<br>

      <p><h4>Classification</h4>
        Web portals are sometimes classified as horizontal or vertical.
        A horizontal portal is used as a platform to several companies
        in the same economic sector or to the same type of manufacturers or distributors.
        A vertical portal (also known as a "vortal") is a specialized entry point to a
        specific market or industry niche, subject area, or interest.
        Some vertical portals are known as "vertical information portals" (VIPs).
        VIPs provide news, editorial content, digital publications, and e-commerce capabilities.
        In contrast to traditional vertical portals, VIPs also provide dynamic multimedia applications including social networking, video posting, and blogging.</p>
