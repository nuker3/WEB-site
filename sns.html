      an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno,
      California.
      The service was created by three former PayPal employees—
      Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—in February 2005.
      Google bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion;
      YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries.<br>

      <p>YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to favorites, report, comment on videos,
        and subscribe to other users. It offers a wide variety of user-generated
        and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short
        and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging,
        short original videos, and educational videos.
        Most of the content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals, but
        media corporations including CBS, the BBC, Vevo,
        and Hulu offer some of their material via YouTube as part of the
        YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch videos on the site,
        while registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos and
        add comments to videos.
        Videos deemed potentially inappropriate are available only to registered
        users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old.

        program which targets ads according to site content and audience.
        The vast majority of its videos are free to view, but there are exceptions,
        including subscription-based premium channels, film rentals, as well as
        YouTube Premium,
        a subscription service offering ad-free
        access to the website and access to exclusive content made in partnership
        with existing users<br></p>

        YouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, who were all early employees of PayPal.
        Hurley had studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim
        studied computer science together at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
        According to a story that has often been repeated in the media,
        Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after
        they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that
        had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco.
        Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred,
        but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party
        "was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story 
        that was very digestible"
